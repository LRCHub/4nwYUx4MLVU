[00:13.35] You've been doin' that nine-to-five straight line walkin'
[00:17.24] Yeah, it's been a long time (yeah, it's been a long time)
[00:20.04] Since I've seen that lettin' down your hair
[00:22.84] Double dog dare look in your eyes
[00:25.64] Oh, and you've been burnin' it at both ends
[00:29.88] Been a hot minute since you flipped that switch
[00:32.84] Girl, it ain't nobody's fault
[00:35.31] Shut the world off and turn it back to when
[00:56.81] 
[00:39.67] It was you, me, and whiskey all night long
[00:43.12] Sinkin' to the bottom of them country songs
[00:46.62] Fire burnin' hot 'til the last drop's gone
[00:49.84] Let's turn it up, turn it up
[00:52.16] 'Til we take that Black Label buzz too far
[00:56.37] And say them things that stay in the dark
[00:59.79] Ain't nothin' as sweet, ain't nothin' as strong
[01:03.18] As you, me, and whiskey all night long
[01:22.18] 
[01:12.92] I see you still got that knock-it-back shot glass
[01:16.52] Girl, you ain't missed a beat
[01:19.79] You already let a little four-letter slip
[01:22.98] And your hands are all over me
[01:25.40] And you're already talkin' dirty and it's only 10:30
[01:29.70] We know where it goes from here
[01:32.46] I can't find this me in a red wine glass
[01:36.33] Yeah, and I can't find it in a beer
[01:53.83] 
[01:39.56] It's you, me, and whiskey all night long
[01:43.22] Sinkin' to the bottom of them country songs
[01:46.65] Fire burnin' hot 'til the last drop's gone
[01:49.75] Let's turn it up, turn it up
[01:52.18] 'Til we take that Black Label buzz too far
[01:56.47] And say them things that stay in the dark
[01:59.86] Ain't nothin' as sweet, ain't nothin' as strong
[02:03.27] As you, me, and whiskey all night long
[02:22.27] 
[02:09.06] Yeah, baby
[02:11.33] Whiskey all night long
[02:22.33] 
[02:19.81] You, me, and whiskey all night long
[02:23.25] Sinkin' to the bottom of them country songs
[02:26.65] Turnin' this house to a honkey-tonk
[02:29.88] Let's turn it up, turn it up
[02:32.25] 'Til we take that Black Label buzz too far
[02:36.49] And say them things that stay in the dark
[02:39.82] Ain't nothin' as sweet, ain't nothin' as strong
[02:43.08] As you, me, and whiskey all night long
[03:02.08] 
[02:49.13] Yeah, whiskey all night long
